# 🧠 RAG QA Bot

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered Question Answering system that uses OpenAI's GPT models and Pinecone vector search to provide accurate, context-aware answers based on web or document content.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a RAG-based QA system using:

- **LangChain** for chaining LLM and retriever logic
- **Pinecone** for semantic search using vector embeddings
- **OpenAI GPT-4** for generating high-quality answers
- **Jupyter Notebook** interface for experimentation and testing

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Load and preprocess web pages or documents
- 🧠 Generate and store text embeddings in Pinecone
- 🔎 Perform semantic search over stored vectors
- 🤖 Generate answers using OpenAI LLM from retrieved context
- 📦 Minimal setup and easily extendable

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- LangChain
- OpenAI API
- Pinecone Vector DB
- Jupyter Notebook
